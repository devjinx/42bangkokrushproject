        <p id="p12" style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px;">Period 1, 1892-1906 (at Sai Chon Na Rangsi Temple) The education of the Thai people in the past did not have a definite pattern. Must rely on the temple as the main source of education for the youth, with a monk who has knowledge of reading and
            writing. and training in morality and ethics Villagers therefore often bring their children to be ordained as disciples. to keep serving teachers and use their free time to learn to read and write according to the teacher's orders or to continue
            the books Later, King Chulalongkorn His Majesty set up many royal schools in Bangkok To set up a school for the people for the first time at Wat Mahannaparam in 1884. People feared that the government set up a school for the people to become
            soldiers. Because being a soldier in those days was very difficult. His Majesty must have a royal command. to clarify and persuade the people to study thus causing the establishment of schools to spread to more and more cities in order Subsequently,
            the establishment of the Department of Education was announced on May 6, 1887 to specifically manage education. and when there are more and more schools Therefore, the status of the Department of Education as the Ministry of Justice on April
            1, 1892, although the schools in Bangkok and the cities will be much more widespread than before. It's still not satisfying His Majesty's heart. His Majesty had the premise that he could provide education to the people thoroughly. So please
            to announce the establishment "School basic education" was established on June 20, 2435 teachers in those days. Including monks living in the temple and teaching according to the ordinary curriculum, divided into 2 levels, namely the lower
            level ordinary school. and the basic high school In the first phase, instructors must collect fees themselves. As an important message announced in the Government Gazette, Volume 9, R.E. 111 (1892), pages 93-95, one part: In addition, at the
            end of the announcement, it was clearly emphasized that â€œThe schools established in monasteries and temples, this announcement, if taught according to the royal school To be counted as all royal schools. throughout the kingdom Including Chachoengsao
            Province as well for the above reasons It shows that after the announcement of the establishment of a basic school on June 20, 1892, the study at Wat Sai Chon Therefore, it has the status of a basic school in Chachoengsao. In the first name,
            probably used the name of the school after the temple name. Using the temple's Sermon Pavilion as an educational institution open to teach both basic and elementary levels. or say Wat Saichon Narangsi School (Laem Bon) is the royal school
